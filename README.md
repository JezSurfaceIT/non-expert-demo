# Non-Expert Insider Threat Demo Platform

**Project Status**: Requirements Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Session Type**: Co-Elicitation Requirements Gathering

---

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive requirements documentation for an insider threat platform designed specifically for organizations **starting their programs from zero**. Unlike traditional solutions that require historical incident data, this platform guides organizations through the complete journey from program approval to operational maturity.

**Key Innovation**: Demonstrates value through program maturity, policy coverage, and risk reduction targets rather than incident metrics - solving the chicken-and-egg problem of establishing insider threat programs.

## Key Insights

### 1. The Chicken-and-Egg Problem
**Traditional approach**: "Show me your incident data, and I'll help you manage it"
**Our approach**: "You have no incidents because you have no program - let's establish one"

### 2. Value Without Incidents
**Dashboard evolution**:
- **Months 0-4**: Program maturity, policy coverage, training completion
- **Months 4-7**: First incidents (3-5), source breakdown, early MTTD/MTTR
- **Months 8-12**: Full KPIs, trends, predictive analytics

### 3. The Purview Surprise
Many organizations have Microsoft 365 E5/A5 licenses but don't know they include **FREE** DLP (Purview). Priority Picker detects this and saves them $15k-$25k in procurement costs.

### 4. AI as Signature Feature
AI Policy Gap Analysis provides **immediate value** (60 seconds to analyze policies) and demonstrates platform intelligence. No competitor offers this.

### 5. Demo Flexibility = Sales Success
Demo Mode System allows sales teams to jump to any maturity stage (Month 0/6/12) and show relevant features. Critical for diverse buyer journeys.

## Questions & Contact

### Common Questions

**Q: Why 40 weeks? Can we go faster?**
A: 40 weeks includes MVP (12), Demo Enhancement (12), Full Capability (16). You can launch MVP-only at Week 12 and iterate based on feedback.

**Q: Can we build this with fewer people?**
A: MVP could be built with 3 FTEs in 16-20 weeks, but quality and features would be reduced. 5 FTEs at 12 weeks is optimal for quality MVP.

**Q: What if GPT-4 API is too expensive?**
A: We estimate $2k-$5k for development, $500-$1k/month in production. Alternative: Use GPT-3.5-turbo (70% cheaper) or open-source models (Llama, Mistral).

**Q: How do we validate market demand?**
A: Interview 10-20 CISOs/Risk Officers from target orgs, present Priority Picker + PPTX concept, measure interest (>70% positive = proceed).

**Q: What about GDPR/privacy concerns?**
A: Platform designed for privacy: encrypted data, role-based access, HR flag restrictions, no employee PII required for most features. Legal review recommended.
