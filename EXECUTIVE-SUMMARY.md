# Executive Summary: Non-Expert Insider Threat Demo Platform

**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Prepared By**: Mary, Business Analyst (Claude Code)
**Session Type**: Co-Elicitation Requirements Gathering
**Status**: Ready for Decision

## The Opportunity

Organizations are increasingly aware of insider threats but lack the expertise, resources, and historical data to establish programs. The market for insider threat management is dominated by tools designed for mature security operations with hundreds of incidents and dedicated teams. **This leaves a critical gap**: organizations that recognize the need but don't know where to start.

**Market Gap**: No solution helps organizations **START** insider threat programs from zero.

---

## The Solution

A demo and educational platform that guides organizations through the complete journey from program approval to operational maturity over 12 months. Unlike traditional security tools that require existing incidents to demonstrate value, this platform shows value through:

- **Program maturity scoring** (instead of incident metrics)
- **Risk reduction targets** (instead of risk reduction actuals)
- **Policy coverage tracking** (instead of policy violations)
- **Training completion rates** (instead of training impact on incidents)

**Core Innovation**: Chicken-and-egg problem solved - provide value BEFORE incidents exist.

---

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **CISO** (recently appointed, inheriting program gaps)
- **Chief Risk Officer** (compliance-focused, identifies insider risk gap)
- **IT Manager** (wearing security hat, no dedicated team)
- **Board Members** (seeking program oversight)

### Organizational Profile
- Small to medium organizations (100-5,000 employees)
- Limited security budgets (<$150k/year for tools)
- No dedicated insider threat staff (0-5 person team)
- No incident history to reference
- Often unaware they already have DLP (Microsoft 365 Purview)

### Market Size Estimate
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: 50,000+ organizations in US with 100+ employees lacking insider threat programs
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: 10,000+ organizations actively seeking security improvements
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: 1,000+ organizations in Year 1 (conservative)

---

## Value Proposition

### For CISOs
**Problem**: Need to justify insider threat program to board without historical data
**Solution**: Auto-generated board-ready presentation with industry benchmarks and ROI projections
**Value**: Program approval in <30 days instead of 3-6 months of manual work

### For Risk Officers
**Problem**: Don't know where insider threat risks exist in organization

## Risks & Mitigation

### Top Risks

**1. AI Policy Analysis Quality**
- **Risk**: AI generates poor recommendations, users lose trust
- **Impact**: High (signature feature)
- **Mitigation**: Use GPT-4, validate with security SME, iterate based on user feedback, offer human review option

**2. Market Education Required**
- **Risk**: Orgs don't know they need this until educated
- **Impact**: Medium (slower sales cycle)
- **Mitigation**: Content marketing, free tier (freemium), partnership with security consultancies

**3. DLP Integration Complexity**
- **Risk**: O365 API integration delays or fails
- **Impact**: Medium (affects Month 4 deployment)
- **Mitigation**: Microsoft partnership, allocate buffer time, offer professional services for integration

**4. Competitive Response**
- **Risk**: Incumbents (Splunk, Exabeam, etc.) add "starter" tiers
- **Impact**: Medium (market entry)
- **Mitigation**: First-mover advantage, AI differentiation, focus on education (not just tool)

**5. Scope Creep**
- **Risk**: Feature requests balloon, timeline slips
- **Impact**: High (budget/schedule)
- **Mitigation**: Strict P0/P1/P2 prioritization, change control, MVP-first mindset

---

## Recommendation

### Strategic Recommendation: **PROCEED**

**Rationale**:
1. **Clear Market Need**: Organizations struggle to start insider threat programs
2. **Differentiated Solution**: No competitor offers zero-incident focused platform
3. **Strong Value Proposition**: Day 1 value (AI gap analysis, PPTX) + long-term value (full platform)
4. **Reasonable Investment**: $1.15M-$1.44M for high-growth market opportunity
5. **Attractive ROI**: 161% Year 1, 260% Year 2, 316% Year 3 (moderate scenario)
6. **Technical Feasibility**: Leverages proven technologies (GPT-4, O365 APIs, standard web stack)

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Execute immediately (Weeks 1-12, $187k-$250k)
- Validate concept with pilot customers
- Refine AI policy analysis based on feedback
- Prove Priority Picker + PPTX drive program approvals

**Go/No-Go Decision**: Week 12 (after MVP)
- If pilot users satisfied (>4/5) and demo-to-engagement >30%: **Proceed to Phase 2**
- If not: **Iterate on MVP**, delay Phase 2 by 4-8 weeks

**Phase 2 (Demo Enhancement)**: If Go (Weeks 13-24, $183k-$243k)
- Enable sales team with demo flexibility
- Build out training and rollout planner
- Expand pilot to 20-50 users

**Phase 3 (Full Capability)**: If strong adoption (Weeks 25-40, $325k-$435k)
- Deliver production-ready platform
- DLP integration for Month 4 milestone
- Launch to market

### Alternative: MVP-Only Launch

**If budget constrained**:
- Execute Phase 1 only ($187k-$250k)
- Launch MVP as "Program Starter Kit"
- Generate revenue before Phase 2/3 investment
- Use customer revenue to fund Phase 2/3

**Pros**: Lower risk, faster time to market
**Cons**: Less demo flexibility, no DLP integration
