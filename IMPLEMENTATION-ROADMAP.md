## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Build MVP Only, Iterate Based on Feedback

**Pros**:
- Lower initial investment ($187k-$250k vs. $695k-$928k)
- Faster time to market (12 weeks vs. 40 weeks)
- Validate concept before full commitment

**Cons**:
- May not be demo-worthy without Phase 2 flexibility
- DLP integration delayed, limiting production use
- Sales team can't show full journey

**Recommendation**: Consider if budget constrained or market uncertainty high

---

### Alternative 2: Outsource AI Policy Analysis

**Pros**:
- Reduce internal AI/ML complexity
- Faster development (eliminate Sprint 3-4 AI work)
- Lower ongoing API costs (fixed fee instead)

**Cons**:
- Dependency on third-party vendor
- Less control over quality
- Potential integration friction

**Recommendation**: Evaluate if in-house AI expertise limited

---

### Alternative 3: Start with DLP Integration First

**Pros**:
- Addresses "Month 4 deployment" directly
- May attract clients with urgent DLP needs

**Cons**:
- Skips "Day 1" value (Priority Picker, PPTX, AI analysis)
- Harder to demo without program establishment features
- Misses core value proposition (help START programs)

**Recommendation**: Not recommended - contradicts core insight that orgs need help BEFORE tooling
